# Property Decorator Getter Setter

In Python, property decorators are used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for class properties. They allow for the encapsulation of data, by controlling access to the underlying data. Property decorators are applied to methods and define how a property value can be retrieved, set, or deleted.
