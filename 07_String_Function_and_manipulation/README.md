## splitlines()

Python splitlines() method splits the string based on the lines. It breaks the string at line boundaries and returns a list of splitted strings. Line breakers can be a new line (\n), carriage return (\r) etc. A table of line breakers are given below which split the string.

## partition()

The partition() method searches for a specified string, and splits the string into a tuple containing three elements. The first element contains the part before the specified string. The second element contains the specified string. The third element contains the part after the string.

Python has several built-in functions associated with the string data type. These functions let us easily modify and manipulate strings. Creating Strings is the simplest and easy to use in Python. To create a string in Python, we simply enclose a text in single as well as double-quotes.
