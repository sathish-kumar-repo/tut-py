# Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location. th operators test if the two operands share an identity. We have two identity operators is and is not. The is operators test If two operands have the same identity, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

# Membership operators

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object. The use membership operators to check whether a value or variable exists in a sequence (string, list, tuples, sets, dictionary) or not. They are two membership python operators in and not in. The in Operator is checks if a value is a member of a sequence. The not in Operator is checks if a value is not a member of a sequence.
