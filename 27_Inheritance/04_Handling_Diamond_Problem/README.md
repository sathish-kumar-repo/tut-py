# Handling Diamond Problem in Python

The diamond problem occurs when two classes have a common parent class, and another class has both those classes as base classes. The diamond problem is the generally used term for an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from a superclass A, and another class D inherits from both B and C.
