# Functions and Types

Python allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as a function. function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task. A function is a reusable block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.

## Two Types of Function :

- User-defined Function: We can create our own function based on our requirements.Standard - Library Function: These are built-in function in python that are available to use.
