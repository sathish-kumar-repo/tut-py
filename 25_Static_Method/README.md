# Static Method

A static method in Python is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. It can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class. Static methods are defined using the @staticmethod decorator, and do not have access to any class-specific state. They are typically used for utility functions that don't need to access any instance-specific data.
